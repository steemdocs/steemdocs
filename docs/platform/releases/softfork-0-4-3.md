# Softfork 0.4.3 Release

This is the third [softfork](/glossary/softfork.md) on the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) as well as the third softfork of HF4. This release fixes unintentional bugs caused by the [0.4.2](/platform/releases/softfork-0-4-2.md) release that prevented the CLI wallet from communicating with steemd unless all plugins were enabled. . It was an optional upgrade for users of [0.4.0](/platform/releases/hardfork-0-4-0.md).

## Features

- No new method or operation were introduced in this hardfork.
- No new method or operation were disabled or deprecated in this hardfork.

## Context of HF4

This was in the very early days Steem were there were only a few people who could access a user interface of the network. The Steemit Inc team, who was mainly in charge of developing the software, iterated quickly through a series of [hardforks](/glossary/hardfork.md) and softforks to make it functional as a decentralized content management system.
