# Hardfork 0.3.0 Release

This is the third [hardfork](/glossary/hardfork.md) of the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) after the original fork from the [Graphene Toolkit](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene). This one was mainly to fix a series of bugs that arised on the network.

- No new method or operation were introduced in this hardfork.
- No new method or operation were disabled or deprecated in this hardfork.

## Context of HF3

This was in the very early days Steem were there were only a few people who could access a user interface of the network. The Steemit Inc team, who was mainly in charge of developing the software, iterated quickly through a series of hardfork to make it functional as a decentralized content management system.
