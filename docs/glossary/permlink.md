# Permlink
A permlink, also called permalink, is a permanent link to a specific piece of content that will remain unchanged. When a piece of content is posted by an [author](/glossary/author.md) on the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), a `root_permlink` is created to allow for all front-end applications to display the content of the blockchain regardless of the root domain. The **permlink** is created via the original title of a post. Once created, it cannot be changed. 

## Permlink for Comments
When a reply or comment is added to a a post, a permlink is created by adding a string of numbers and letters to the `root_permlink`. This string is made of information such as the date, time and other unique identifiers.
