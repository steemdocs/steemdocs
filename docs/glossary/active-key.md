# Active Keys

**Active keys** are used to make [transfers](/glossary/transfer.md) and place orders on the [internal market](/glossary/internal-market) of the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md).  Everytime a user does a transfer, he/she is signing each [transaction](/glossary/transaction.md) with their **active [private key](/glossary/private-key.md)**. Then, the system validates the transactions by using the **active [public key](/glossary/public-key.md)**. Authenticated transactions are added to the [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md), while non-authenticated ones are rejected.

## Active Keys - Finding and Changing Them

A user can find their public **active key** by going to https://steemd.com/@your_username under the "Authority" widget. Alternatively, he/she can find their private and public **active keys** by going to https://steemit.com/@your_username/permissions. Finally, a user can change them by changing the password of their [owner's key](/glossary/owner-key.md)
