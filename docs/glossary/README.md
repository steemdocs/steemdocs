## How to Contribute to the Glossary of Terms

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1::tada:

The Steem Documentation Network wouldn't be anything without people like you making it better and better. Please make sure to review our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/kareniel/steem-docs/contributing.md) and our [code of conduct](https://github.com/kareniel/steem-docs/code_of_conduct.md) documents before sending your first pull request!

## Glossary Formating

We would suggest that you look through a few glossary term before making your first pull request. It is best for the user to have a uniform experience across the website. All of the content on the website uses markdown documents.

#### Paragraph Formating

Try to keep the number of lines within a paragraph to something that is comfortable to the eyes. Too short and it looks sparse, too long at people's eye glaze and give up before reading. 

#### Hyperlinks

Only one hyperlink per term per entry. If the same term come more than once in a given description, don't create an hyperlink on it. Try to hyperlink to as many Steem related glossary terms within a given entry (within reason of course).

#### Using Strong and Italic Font Type

We use the (**) strong type to highlight the main term of a glossary within it's entry and not to highlight phrases or important information. If you want to highlight a particular sentence or word, please use the italic font type(*).
