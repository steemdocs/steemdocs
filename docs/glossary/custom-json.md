# Custom JSON Operation

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. On the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), **custom JSON** are used to store and organize content, implement features such as “[following](/glossary/follow.md)”, "[resteem](/glossary/resteem.md)", and other features that do not require changes in currency validation logic.

The **Custom JSON** operations feature was introduced in [Hardfork 5 (HF5)](/platform/releases/hardfork-0-5-0.md).
